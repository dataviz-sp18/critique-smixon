### Link to visualization - Gender Pay Gap

<https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2018/apr/05/women-are-paid-less-than-men-heres-how-to-fix-it>

A critique of the second graphic entitled "Women are more likely to be underpaid in certain sectors".

Is it truthful?
---------------

First of all, the data is self-reported by eligble countries under the U.K.'s Equality Act. Because companies do appear to have unfavorable pay gaps, the assumption is that the data itself is likely true. The interactive portion of the visualization highlights the gender pay gap by sector. Even though the gender pay gap is widely scrutinized, the visualization does represent sectors that have close to pay parity. If this wasn't present, there could be some question about whether or not the visualization represented the whole story. However, the scale is quite large, and it does not offer a clear picture of what is be happening in the right-hand tail.

Is it functional?
-----------------

The purpose of the visualization is to show how the gender pay gap changes across sector. It shows a distribution for each sector, which might not be initially accessible to the general public. The visualization lends itself more to the story that sectors tend to pay women less - that these numbers are heavily skewed to the right. It takes a little more time to understand the average pay gap for each sector, with respect to the distribution.

Is it beautiful?
----------------

Overall, the visualization is simple and clear. Colors are used to distinguish sectors favorable and unfavorable pay gaps for women. The sectors are stacked, but the visualization is mostly clear, with some overlapping as sectors tend to pay parity. The visualization does a good job of labeling the axes and observations.

Is it insightful?
-----------------

Because the viewer has to click through the visualization and explanations, it lends itself better to knowledge building. The viewer sees how which sectors have a large gender pay gap and the sectors that have pay gaps in favor of women. The choice of visualization - using distributions - makes this interactivity necessary, though. In other words, the visualization is not super intuitive, and the click through explanations provide insight.

Is it enlightening?
-------------------

This visualization comes many years after the implementation of the UK's Equality Act. This visualization serves as a summary of the data gathered under a national policy. Plus, this topic spans world-wide, and this visualization adds to the conversation of how prevalent the gender pay gap remains.
